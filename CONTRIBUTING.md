# Reporting Bugs

If the game stops working, it usually displays a `SIMULATION BROKE :(` message in an editor that automatically opens, or in a `cb_last_error.txt` file in your system's temporary directory.

**First look if your issue has already been reported:**
* [as a Bug](https://github.com/citybound/citybound/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22P%20Bug%22%20)
* [as Not Fun](https://github.com/citybound/citybound/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22P%20Not%20Fun%22%20)
* [as an Annoyance](https://github.com/citybound/citybound/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22P+Annoyance%22)

If not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/aeickhoff/citybound/issues/new).

* Please provide details
    * what platform you're on
    * what you were trying to do or what you expected to happen
    * what actually happened
    * the detailed error information
* Ideally: If the game is still running, take one or several screenshots (camera controls continue to work in many cases)
* Perfect: Provide precise instructions on how to reproduce the problem (if possible)

# Contributing to the Design Doc

The [Design Doc](game/README.md) outlines the philosophy and decisions that I follow when implementing Citybound.

You can make suggestions of every kind:

* typos/formatting/clarification
* feature requests
* complete system design proposals

**[All existing design proposals](https://github.com/citybound/citybound/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr%20label%3A%22DESIGN%20PROPOSAL%22%20)**

* If you have some rough ideas, it is probably best to discuss them in the [official community](https://reddit.com/r/Citybound) first, where people can give you first feedback and point you to existing relevant Design Proposals
* If you have an original and detailed proposal, start editing relevant documents of the Design Doc, or add new ones
  * [Small tutorial on how to do that in the GitHub Web interface](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
  * Please give your Pull Request the DESIGN PROPOSAL label
  * Invite people from the [official community](https://reddit.com/r/Citybound) or authors of other Design Proposals to comment on and suggest improvements/clarifications to your pull request
  * I will take a look at your pull request and give it a detailed review if it meets minimal quality standards
  * We will iterate on it together, a process in which you have the opportunity to explain your motivation and potentially convice me to do things in the way you suggested
  * **Make sure to <a href="https://www.clahub.com/agreements/citybound/citybound">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a>.**
  * In the end, we either
     * fully agree with your proposal and merge it into the official design doc, or:
     * we identify a compromise of a subset of the proposed changes and merge that, or:
     * if our disagreement is too large, the pull request gets closed, but with a thorough explanation from my side

# Contributing Code

## Compiling and running Citybound yourself

**Please note,** newest commits on master might temporarily be broken or represent work-in-progress state.

Recommended setup:
* Install prerequisites
  * Windows/Mac: download and run the installers of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * Windows: additionally install the Visual Studio 2017 build tools from http://aka.ms/buildtools
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install npm nodejs git curl libssl-dev pkg-config`
* **Windows: run all following steps inside the Git Bash that came with Git**
  * if you have followed all necessary steps, but Git Bash complains about not finding a command (such as node or rustup), try restarting Git Bash first and `cd citybound` again
* `git clone https://github.com/citybound/citybound.git`
* `cd citybound`
* `npm run ensure-tooling`
  * Follow instructions
  * install rustup if asked to
    * (Mac/Ubuntu: run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` like it suggests)
    * then rerun `npm run ensure-tooling`
* Run the following two commands in parallel in two separate terminals (in the citybound directory)
   * `npm run watch-browser` to continuously build the browser UI 
     * Might take long the first time - installs and compile dependencies
     * Recompiles automatically after changes, just reload browser to get them
   * `npm start` to build and then run the server
     * Might take long the first time - installs and compile dependencies
     * If you get a bug about the `cb_browser_ui/dist` directory missing, wait for `npm run watch-browser` to complete, then restart `npm start`

* Open the displayed address in your browser

## Compiling and running Citybound in Docker

To run Citybound from a Docker container, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then, open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser to begin playing.

## Guidelines

* **Make sure to <a href="https://www.clahub.com/agreements/citybound/citybound">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a>.**
* **[Have a look at the documentation](http://citybound.github.io/citybound)**
* **Citybound uses trunk-based development,** meaning a very recent work-in-progress state of the code is always in the master branch. The repository owner usually commits directly to master, or uses short-lived feature branches. Contributors use the common fork/pull-request flow and everyone involved tries to get the changes into master as quickly as possible. The newest commits in master might sometimes be broken and not run.

## Conforming to style

* Run `npm run lint` and fix at least formatting issues that couldn't be fixed automatically. If you have time, adress any best-practises issues it raises.
